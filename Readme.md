## How it works
### 1. Real-Time Messaging (WebSockets via Django Channels)
#### -> When a user logs in and opens a chat, the frontend opens a WebSocket connection to the backend server.

#### -> This connection stays open, allowing live two-way communication between client and server.

#### -> When a message is sent, it is immediately broadcast to the recipient or the group using Channels.

#### -> The receiverâ€™s frontend gets the new message instantly without refreshing.

### 2. Creating or Joining Chat Rooms
#### -> Users can: Create a new chat room (for group chats) Or automatically join a one-to-one private chat when messaging a friend.

#### -> The backend identifies rooms using unique room names or IDs.

#### -> When a user selects a chat, they are subscribed to that room's channel via WebSocket.


### 3. Sending and Receiving Messages
#### -> When a user types and sends a message:

#### -> It is sent through the WebSocket connection to the backend.

#### -> The backend processes the message, saves it to the database, and broadcasts it to the correct chat room.

#### -> All participants in that chat room receive the message in real time.


### 4. Message Storage and History
#### -> Every message is stored in a PostgreSQL database with metadata (sender, timestamp, room).

#### -> When a user opens a chat, the app fetches previous messages via REST API (or GraphQL) to show chat history.

#### -> Older messages remain available unless deleted or cleared by users.
